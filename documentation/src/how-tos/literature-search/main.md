# Literature search

## General

Searching, finding, reading, evaluating, and summarizing research articles are vital skills for academics, researchers, and anyone seeking reliable information. These processes form the backbone of evidence-based knowledge and contribute significantly to the advancement of various fields. It may not be obvious how to do this, and this entry will help with this. It is a living document.

## Resources

### Search engines

There are a few search engines that can be used to find articles. They differ in their scope, how they present the results and what sort of filters can be applied. The two main ones recommended for use are:

- [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
- [Google Scholar](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

### Preprints

Preprints are early versions of research papers that are shared publicly before undergoing formal peer review. They allow researchers to disseminate their findings rapidly, promoting collaboration and feedback within the scientific community. While preprints provide valuable opportunities for knowledge exchange, readers should interpret them with caution since they have not undergone rigorous peer review.

Most literature that will be interesting to use can be found on:

- [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)
- [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/)

### Semantic search engines

More recently, platforms have been developed to allow for the search of publications that are related to other publications. Examples of these include:

- [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
- [Research Rabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)

Note: These platforms may be experimental and also may reinforce specific biases.
