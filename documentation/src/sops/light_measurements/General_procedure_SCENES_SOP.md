## Day before measurement

#### Checklist: Make sure the following devices are fully charged. Do not let the devices charge throughout the entire night to prevent battery damage!

1.  Laptop
2.  Tablet
3.  Four external Makita batteries
4.  2 GoPro Hero 10 batteries (black and white batteries)

#### Checklist: Make sure the following devices, cables and materials are in the shell-backpack

1.  Intel RealSenseD455 depth camera + brass screw
2.  GoPro Hero 10 + battery + 512 Gb microSD-card + long black screw
3.  Hard-Drive + USB 3.0 cable
4.  mini-USB cable (for Testo 175 H1)
5.  Laptop charger
6.  WP690 power cable
7.  Jeti diffusor
8.  micro-USB-cables for Acttrusts

#### Checklist: Make sure the following devices, cables and accessories are in/on the black box

1.  Circadiometer WP690 with attached lens cover
2.  Spectroradiometer Jeti 1511 with attached lens cover (orientated in the correct direction. The orientation of the mounting can be changed by loosening the large brass screw on the device
3.  Colorimeter Klein K10-A
4.  Temperature/Humidity logger Testo 175 H1 (mounting on the back of the box)
5.  USB-C-cable (for Depth camera)

#### Checklist: Make sure the following procedures are completed

1.  Devices on the rail inside the black box should be put in the back position (so closing the front lid does not cause damage to the devices)
2.  The white lid for the front opening of the black box is attached with all four hinges
3.  The two Actigraphs, their two data-transfer-casings, their two measurement-casings and a thin screwdriver are put on the table next to the (charged) laptop
4.  Put the charged Makita batteries in the battery backpack
5.  The Testo display says "REC" for recording
6.  Optional: If you plan to do measurements where power is available, prepare a sufficient extension cable and a multiple power socket
    &rarr Additional device-specific procedures are included in the device SOPs (Templates/documentation/src/sops/light_measurement_devices)

## Day of measurement

_Come in the office 30-45 minutes before the planned first measurement_

### Pre-measurement procedure

#### Actigraph preparation

1.  Use the screwdriver to put the two Actigraphs in the data-transfer-casings (old/white & new/white)
2.  Turn on the laptop and start the Acttrust software
3.  Attach the first data-transfer-casings to the laptop using the micro-USB cable.
4.  If the reading in the software says "ACTIVE", the device is activated. It can now be put in the measurement casing using the screwdriver.
5.  Repeat steps 3 & 4 with the respective other Actigraph
6.  Put the Actigraphs in their measurement-casings in the shell-backpack

#### Setup preparation

1.  Put the laptop and tablet in the shell backpack
2.  Wind up the cable bundle and put it inside the black box
3.  Close the upper lid of the black box

#### Set up transportation to the location of measurement

1.  Timelapse: Attach the black box and the tripod to the silver transportation trolly. Pull out its handle at the bottom by pressing the button on the top of the handle. Be careful when pulling the trolley not to lose balance! You need two operators to carry the battery backpack and the shell backpack. Also, from September 2023, we have a trolly attached to the black box for easy transportation.
2.  Trajectory: Carry the black box, tripod and battery backpack to the car used for transportation and load them carefully in safe and stable positions.

#### Setting up the equipment

1.  Position the tripod securely at the desired position so that the wide opening of the mounting faces the direction that you want to measure. Use the large handle underneath the mounting to elevate the mount to the desired position. Fixate all screws on the legs of the tripod to increase stability.
2.  Open the steel handle at the bottom of the tripod mounting and carefully insert the base of the black box into the mount. Afterward, close the steel handle again to secure the black box in the mount.
3.  Hold your device with the compass app horizontally against the black box and read out the direction the box is facing (in degrees), the elevation (in m) and the position in coordinates (iPhone smartphones allow this with the integrated app "Compass").
4.  Attach the GoPro and the Depth camera to their mountings. Also, attach the two Actigraphs in their measurement-casings on the steel plate at the front of the black box using the magnets.
5.  Turn on the laptop and attach the USB hub.
6.  Open the upper lid of the black box and insert the micro-USB cable in its socket in the Jeti. Also, attach the magnet on the cable to the steel plate behind the Jeti.
7.  Detach the white lid on the front of the black box and pull the rail for the devices in the forward position.
8.  Unroll the cable bundle and attach the USB cables (WP690 directly to the laptop and the others to the USB hub (also connect the hard drive to the USB hub).
9.  If power is available, use the WP690 power cable. If not, attach the WP690 cable from the cable bundle to the battery backpack. Insert the other end of the cable into the WP690 (if you use the power cable, tighten the thread for one rotation).

### Measurement procedures

1.  Follow the device-specific SOPs to perform the measurements (LabHandbook/documentation/src/sops/light-measurement-devices/).
2.  After every measurement, create a new record in the project _SCENES_ in the REDCap mobile APP (Username: Chrono*redcap; PW: \_for this info, ask Alexander Hahn or Niloufar Tabdandehsaravi*) to properly maintain the metadata.

### Post-measurement procedures

1.  After finishing the last measurement, shut down all software/instruments and make sure the data is saved. Do all this according to the device-specific SOPs!
2.  Attach the lens protection to WP690 and Jeti (after taking the lens off Jeti).
3.  Remove the GoPro, Depth camera and Actigraphs from the black box and put them in the shell backpack.
4.  Wind up the cables (about a forearm-length in diameter) and put them inside the black box.
5.  Transport the setup back to the office. Orientate yourself on the subpoint "Setup transportation to the measurement location".
6.  Data saving from the devices Testo, GoPro and Actigraphs should be done according to the device-specific SOPs.
