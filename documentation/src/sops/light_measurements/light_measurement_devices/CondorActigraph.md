# Standard Operating Procedure for actigraph

This SOP provides an overview over project specific measurements with the Actigraph-devices ActTrust (old) & ActTrust2 (new) by Condor Instruments for the project ReWoCap. General handling of the device is decribed in another SOP.

## Start up

Checklist for materials

1.  ActTrust, SN: 02513
1.  ActTrust 2, SN: AT201635
1.  Laptop
1.  Data-transfer-casing for both devices
1.  Hard-drive
1.  Measurement-casing for both devices
1.  ActTrust software
1.  micro-USB cable
1.  Screw driver

Start up system
(_The devices need to be started up before leaving the office/lab_)

1.  Put the the devices in the data-transfer-casings (old &rarr; white / new &rarr; black) using the screw driver. The connector-fields on the device have to have a physical connection to the pins of the casings.
1.  Open the ActTrust software on the laptop.
1.  A notification window opens up asking whether you want to configure the positional information of the device. Close the window.
1.  Connect one of the data-transfer-casings to the laptop using the micro-USB cable. Information about the device should now be displayed in the software. Make sure that the device status is "active". The device activates itself once it is connected to the software.
1.  Disconnect the device from the micro-USB without closing the software.
1.  Connect the other casing with the device in it. Same procedure as with the first Actigraph
1.  The devices are now started/active and make continuous measurements until they are turned off.

## Pre-Measurement procedure

_The devices make measurements before the start of the actual measurement. This section describes the handling between activation and start of the actual measurement procedure._

1.  After activation, take devices out of the data-transfer-casings using the screw driver.
2.  Put the devices in the measurement-casings using the screw driver (the light sensor has to be orientated towards the opening of the casing).
3.  Carry all the instruments, including the actigraphs, to the measurement location and set up the light measurement devices in the desired position.
4.  Stick them to the black box using the magnets (on the metal panel next to the large opening for WP690, Klein and Jeti)

## Measurement procedure

1.  The actigraphs make continuous measurements after their activation and no further measurement procedure is required.

## Data Saving and Shut Down

1.  After the measurement campaign of the day has ended, bring all the instruments, including the actigraphs, back to the office/lab.
2.  Take the actigraphs in their measurement-casings of the black box and take them out of the casings using the screw driver.
3.  Put the actigraphs into the data-transfer-casings.
4.  Open the ActTrust-Software on the laptop.
5.  Connect the data-transfer-casings to the laptop using the micro-USB
6.  Scroll down to the button "Finish trail" to transfer the data to the desired location (Hard-Drive &rarr; rewocap &rarr; data &rarr; raw &rarr; ID (e.g., 1001_20230208) &rarr; create a new folder named "100X_acttrust" where you save the data). Press the button and wait until it reaches 100%.
7.  Press the button "Clear memory" to delete the data.
8.  Press the button "Power down" to turn the device off.
9.  Detach the device from the micro-USB-cable
10. Repeat the procedure with the other actigraph.
11. In the folder "100X_acttrust" should now be four files.
