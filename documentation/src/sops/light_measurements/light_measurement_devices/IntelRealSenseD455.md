## Pre-measurement procedure

1.  General: Place the entire measurement setup in the desired position
2.  Take the D455 out of its casing from the portable backpack
3.  Use the little screw to attach the D455 to the mounting in the middle left part of the front of the box

## Measurement procedure

1.  Data is saved automatically in "Documents".
2.  Automated saving/renaming
    1. Transfer the files into the designated folder that is used by the Python Code for automated renaming (if you donÂ´t know the name of the folder, you can look it up in the header of the code).
    2. Follow the instructions in the header of the Python-Code and subsequently run the code.
3.  Manual saving/renaming
    1. Rename each file to inteld455_year:month:dayTmeasurementtime (e.g. inteld455_20230208T0930.bag)
    2. Transfer the renamed file to Hard-Drive &rarr; rewocap &rarr; data &rarr; raw &rarr; ID (e.g., 1001_20230208)
